# My UI Kit and Component Library

This is a reusable **UI Kit** and **Component Library** designed for building modern mobile and web applications. It aims to provide a set of customizable, reusable components that are scalable, accessible, and easy to use. The library is built using **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **TypeScript**, and is designed to work seamlessly with both web and mobile platforms.

## Features

- **Reusable Components**: Modular components that can be used across different parts of the app.
- **Scalable**: Easily add new components in the future.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works for both web and mobile apps.
- **Customizable**: Easily modify components with theming and styling support.
- **Responsive Design**: Built to be responsive and work on multiple screen sizes.
- **Accessibility**: Follows best practices for accessibility.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple API for developers and designers.
- **Performance Optimized**: Lightweight and fast components for optimal performance.
- **Testing & Documentation**: Components are well-tested and documented.

## Tech Stack

- **React** (for web and mobile components)
- **Tailwind CSS** (for styling)
- **TypeScript** (for type safety)
- **PostCSS/Sass** (optional for advanced styling)
- **Vite** or **Webpack** (for bundling)
- **Jest & React Testing Library** (for unit testing)
- **Cypress** (for end-to-end testing)
- **Storybook** (for live documentation)

## Project Structure


## Steps to Create the Library

### 1. **Planning Your UI Kit and Component Library**

Key Requirements:

- **Reusable Components**: Ensure your components are modular and reusable.
- **Scalability**: Your library should scale to accommodate future components.
- **Cross-Platform**: The library should be compatible with web and mobile apps.
- **Theming Support**: Components should be customizable via themes.
- **Responsive Design**: Components should work across multiple screen sizes.
- **Accessibility**: Components should follow accessibility best practices.
- **Ease of Use**: The API should be easy to use and intuitive for developers.
- **Performance**: Optimize components for speed, especially for mobile.

### 2. **Tech Stack**

- **React** or **React Native** for building the components.
- **Tailwind CSS** or **Styled Components** for styling.
- **TypeScript** for type safety.
- **Storybook** for component documentation and testing.
- **Vite** or **Webpack** for bundling.

### 3. **Set Up the Project Structure**

The recommended directory structure is as follows:

- **components/**: Reusable components (e.g., Button, Input, Modal).
- **themes/**: Store your themes and styles here.
- **utils/**: Any helper functions or utilities that aid in component development.
- **tests/**: Test components for functionality and behavior.
- **dist/**: Output of the build process (compiled components).
- **src/**: Source code files for the library.
- **package.json**: Project metadata and dependencies.
- **tailwind.config.js**: Tailwind configuration.
- **postcss.config.js**: PostCSS configuration for processing styles.

### 4. **Designing Reusable Components**

Here's an example of a reusable **Button** component:

```tsx
// src/components/Button/Button.tsx
import React from "react";

type ButtonProps = {
  onClick: () => void;
  variant?: "primary" | "secondary";
  size?: "small" | "medium" | "large";
  disabled?: boolean;
  children: React.ReactNode;
};

const Button = ({ onClick, variant = "primary", size = "medium", disabled, children }: ButtonProps) => {
  const baseClasses = "py-2 px-4 rounded-md focus:outline-none";
  const variantClasses = {
    primary: "bg-blue-500 text-white hover:bg-blue-600",
    secondary: "bg-gray-500 text-white hover:bg-gray-600",
  };
  const sizeClasses = {
    small: "text-sm",
    medium: "text-base",
    large: "text-lg",
  };
  const disabledClasses = disabled ? "opacity-50 cursor-not-allowed" : "";

  return (
    <button
      onClick={onClick}
      className={`${baseClasses} ${variantClasses[variant]} ${sizeClasses[size]} ${disabledClasses}`}
      disabled={disabled}
    >
      {children}
    </button>
  );
};

export default Button;
